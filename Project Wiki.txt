Week 1 topics:
	Lookup the 802.11a OFDM system design parameters
	■ Bandwidth, sub-carrier spacing, number of sub-carriers, IFFT/ FFT size, number of data sub-carriers, number of pilot sub-carriers:
		- Bandwidth: ieee802-11 supports signals with a bandwidth of 20MHz
		- Sub-carrier spacing: derived from the bandwith and FFT size => 20Mhz/64 = 312.5kHz
		- Sampling rate: 20Msamples/s
		- IFFT/FFT size: 64
		- Nº data sub-carriers: 48 (FFT-Pilot-DC-guard = 64-4-1-11 = 48)
		- Nº pilot sub-carriers: 4 

	■ Why are there unused sub-carriers and where are they located?
		- No sub-carriers are unsused, they are just unsused for data specificaly; Given that the sub-carriers that aren't used for data are the DC and Guard sub-carriers, for a total of 1+11=12 sub-carriers
	
	
	■ OFDM symbol duration, sampling rate, OFDM symbol length (samples), cyclic prefix length
		- Symbol duration: (80 samples) / (20Msamples/s) = 4us
		- Sampling rate: 1/4us = 250Ksymbols/s
		- Symbol length: 80 samples (64 data + 16 cyclic prefix)
		- cyclic prefix length: 16 samples
	
	
	■ Frame prefix sequence, length, repetition, duration
		○ Read section 2.1 and understand what it means
			- Section 2.1 outlines the structure of the OFDM Receiver: Frame detection and Frame decoding. As for the frame prefix, it's used a short training sequence with 16 samples that repeats a total of 10 times. The total duration is 8us => (16 samples * 10 repetitions) / (20MHz sampling rate) = 8us
			
	■ Where are the mentioned tags?
		○ Work yourself through Section 2.2
		
	■ Identify the blocks that calculate the autocorrelation
	
	■ Identify the blocks that calculate the power
	
	■ Try to obtain a graph like Figure 2
	
	■ Explore the effect of varying NWin, e.g. in the graph like Figure 2
	

Week 2
	■ Understand the OFDM Sync Short block
		○ What does the block do
		○ What is the meaning of the thresholds
		○ Explore the effect of changing the thresholds
		○ Understand the limitations of the approach taken, and try to demonstrate a case where it breaks



Week 3
■ Understand the block OFDM Sync Long (Section 2.3)
■ Understand the algorithm for frequency offset correction.
○ Where is it implemented?
○ Which parameters could you vary?
○ Why is there a delayed input? Could you change that value and what would the impact be of doing that?
Week 4
■ Understand symbol alignment (Section 2.4)
○ How is symbol alignment done (algorithm logic)?
○ Why is matched filtering used for symbol alignment but not for frame detection?
○ Have a look at the code that implements equation 6.
○ Why do you add 64 in expression 7?
■ What does the stream to vector block do?

Week 5
■ Understand Phase Offset Correction (Section 2.5)
○ Why do you need to correct the phase?
○ Find the code that estimates the phase offset
○ How are you correcting the phase, i.e. which values are being changed?

Week 6
■ Understand the OFDM Equalize Symbols module
○What does it do?
○ Why is the implementation limited to deal with BPSK and QPSK
modulation?
○ Which other functions are performed in this block?
■ Work through Section 2.7
○ Look up the frame format for 802.x frames and how the data in the initial fields is transmitted. You are already looking into the MAC layer.
•	Recall what you learned in Computer Networks course about framing. How can you delimit a frame?
○ What is the Signal Field? Which information is sent there? Why is this information necessary?
○ How is that information encoded?

Week 7
■ Work through decoding the payload (Section 2.8)
○ Which abstract receiver blocks are within the module OFDM Decode Mac?
○ How many constellation symbols are demodulated at once? Why? Can you change this? What is the impact of changing this?
•	What is the actual process of digital demodulation? What is the input and the output, and how is the conversion done? Look at the code if necessary.
○ Understand what is de-interleaving.
•	Watch the video in Panopto explaining what is de-interleaving.
•	Find the code that does de-interleaving and understand it.
○ Understand de-scrambling
•	What is scrambling/ descrambling? Why is it used?
•	How can the receiver de-scramble without explicit knowledge of the scrambler initial state?
■ Which fields of the received frames are used and how?

Week 8
■ Understand the decoding (Section 2.8)
○ Will add detailed questions about the decoding later
■ Try out your 802.11a receiver with a real 802.11a access point. Can you see the received frames?
○ Read Section 8 (Interoperability)
